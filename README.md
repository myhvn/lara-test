## Installation 
Make sure that you have setup the environment properly. You will need minimum PHP 8.2, PostgreeSQL, and composer.I developed it using laravel version 11!

Just because of laravel 11 i have some issuses with dependencies whille i tried to add API controllers and RouteServiceProvider.It wants me to add additional files and dependencies to project,which takes a quite lot time for it.So if i`m real candidate for this position - i can make it,but i need more time that i said before.

1. Download the project (or clone using GIT)
2. Copy `.env.example` into `.env` and configure your database credentials and path for google sheets file(credentials.json)
3. Go to the project's root directory using terminal window/command prompt
4. Run `composer install`
5. Set the application key by running `php artisan key:generate --ansi`
6. Run migrations `php artisan migrate`
7. Start local server by executing `php artisan serve`
8. Visit here [http://127.0.0.1:8000/register](http://127.0.0.1:8000/register) or http://127.0.0.1:8000/home to test the application
